## Operational Insights
1.  **Barista is the Constraint:** The Barista station is the primary bottleneck. With a speed of 0.8 drinks/min, they cannot handle the peak morning rush (often >1.5 orders/min).
    *   *Recommendation:* Add a second barista or "floater" during 7am-10am.
2.  **Rico Cash Adoption:** ~4% of revenue was paid via Rico Cash. This indicates early adoption of the loyalty loop.
3.  **Membership Conversions:** Solid conversion rate (~5% of non-VIPs). The L500 bonus is an effective hook.

## Top Selling Categories
1.  **Mocha / Cappuccino** (High complexity drinks -> slowed down bar).
2.  **Cold Brew** (Faster to serve).
